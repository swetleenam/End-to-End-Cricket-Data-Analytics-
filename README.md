# Cricket Data Analytics Project: Web Scraping, Python, Pandas & Power BI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cricket data analytics by scraping data from ESPN Cricinfo to identify the best 11 players for a hypothetical T20 match. It involves web scraping, data transformation, algorithm implementation, and visualization using Python, Pandas, and Power BI.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Automated data extraction using Python and Bright Data tools.
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and ensured consistent data with Pandas.
- **Player Selection Algorithm**: Optimized team selection using key performance metrics such as batting average, strike rate, and bowling economy.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Designed and implemented insightful visualizations with Power BI and Power Query.
- **Final Presentation**: Clear and actionable insights on player statistics, trends, and team composition.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Utilized Bright Data tools to scrape match results and player performance statistics from ESPN Cricinfo.
2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Removed duplicates.
   - Handled missing values.
   - Transformed the data into a consistent format for analysis using Pandas.
3. **Algorithm Development**:
   - Created algorithms to evaluate player performance and select the optimal team based on defined metrics.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to showcase insights.
   - Performed advanced data transformations with Power Query for visual enhancements.
5. **Presentation**:
   - Highlighted player statistics, trends, and recommendations in the final dashboard.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Web scraping (Bright Data tools) and data processing (Pandas).
- **Power BI**: Visualization and dashboards.
- **Power Query**: Data transformations for enhanced insights.
